# AI Shopping Agent - Project Proposal

## Background

With an overwhelming array of products available on e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Walmart, and Ebay, selecting the best product to meet individual needs has become increasingly challenging. While reviews and ratings provide some insights, they often fail to capture a holistic consensus across diverse user communities. Platforms like Reddit offer invaluable human feedback through authentic discussions and detailed recommendations that reflect real-world experiences.

## Project Description:

AI-Powered Shopping Agent represents a significant leap forward in leveraging collective intelligence for e-commerce. By bridging the gap between community-driven recommendations and seamless shopping experiences, we aim to revolutionize how consumers discover and purchase products. This project not only addresses current challenges in online shopping but also paves the way for a more transparent, efficient, and user-centric e-commerce ecosystem. The successful implementation of ReddiShop has the potential to disrupt the traditional recommendation systems market and set new standards for authenticity and user trust in online shopping.
